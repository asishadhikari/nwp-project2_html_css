After  the  Links  section  there  is  a  short copyright  notice that  appears  as  a  section  of pre-formatted  textin  a monospace font. 


The text is spaced such that the last letter lines up on horizontally for each of the three lines.

The names of the four major steps of the recipe directions(such as "Preheat Oven") are strongly emphasized. 

The quotations from the users appear in an  italic font  as indented blocks with background color #FFFFA8(red=255, green=255, blue=168). Some words in the last quote are bolded for emphasis.

The picture of the pie and the W3C validator imagesat the bottom come from the following images, respectively: 
	pie.jpg(use an absolute URL to link to this image; don't link to a relative URL on your hard drive)
	w3c-html.png
	w3c-css.png

The page bottom has four links:
	+ The "Home" link should go to your index.htmlpage. Use a relative URL and assume it is located on the same site and directory as pie.html.
 	+ The "Search for other lemon meringue pie recipes" text, "W3C HTML5" button, and "W3C CSS" button should link to the following web pages, 
 		respectively:
 			http://www.google.com/search?q=lemon+meringue+pie+recipe&start=10
 			validate-html.php(this is our custom W3C HTML validator)
 			validate-css.php(this is our custom W3C CSS validator)

** Favicon: Set the page to have a "favorites icon" ("favicon"). Use:pie-icon.gif

Pie bullet: Set all bulleted lists of items on the page to use an image for their bullet icon rather than thenormal black circle. Use the following image: pie-icon.gif

** Wide headings: Place 0.25em horizontal spacing between neighboring letters in all headings on the page

Tight heading background: Make it so that the gray background behind the headings on the page is onlybehind the text itself, not stretched across the entire width of the page. (Looks nice with extra feature #1.)
